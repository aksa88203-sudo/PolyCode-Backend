# C Learning Resources

All C programming concepts organized with paired .c (code) and .md (documentation) files in the same folders, matching the C++ structure.

## 🎯 Structure Concept

Each folder represents a major topic area. Within each folder:
- **`.c` files**: Runnable C code implementations
- **`.md` files**: Documentation and detailed explanations

**Example**: 
- `data_structures/Linked_Lists.c` - Working code
- `data_structures/Linked_Lists.md` - Explanation and concepts

## 📂 Main Categories

Each project folder contains both `.c` (code) and `.md` (documentation)

## 🔗 How to Use This Structure

1. **Pick a Concept**: Choose a folder that interests you
2. **Read the Documentation**: Start with the `.md` file
3. **Study the Code**: Review the corresponding `.c` file
4. **Compile and Run**: Execute the code to see it in action
5. **Experiment**: Modify the code and test your understanding

## 🎯 Learning Tips

- **Read first**: Get understanding from `.md` files
- **Study code**: See implementation in `.c` files
- **Experiment**: Modify and compile the code
- **Compare**: See how different concepts work together in projects
- **Reference**: Return to files when you need quick lookup

## 🔧 Compilation Notes

```bash
# Basic compilation
gcc -o output filename.c

# With warnings
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o output filename.c

# With debugging symbols
gcc -g -o output filename.c

# Multiple files
gcc -o output file1.c file2.c file3.c
```
