## Introduction to Graphs

### What is a Graph?
A graph is a data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links).

### Graph Components
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Entities or points in the graph
- **Edges (Links)**: Connections between vertices
- **Weight**: Cost or distance associated with edges
- **Direction**: Whether edges are one-way or two-way

### Graph Types
- **Undirected**: Edges have no direction (friendship network)
- **Directed**: Edges have direction (web links, road network)
- **Weighted**: Edges have costs (distances, time)
- **Unweighted**: All edges have equal cost

### Applications
- **Social Networks**: Friend relationships, influence
- **Transportation**: Road networks, flight paths
- **Computer Networks**: Network topology, routing
- **Recommendation Systems**: Product recommendations
- **Bioinformatics**: Protein interactions, evolutionary trees

## Graph Representations

### Adjacency Matrix

#### Concept
2D array where matrix[i][j] represents edge from vertex i to vertex j.

#### Implementation
```python
class AdjacencyMatrix:
    """Adjacency matrix representation"""
    
    def __init__(self, num_vertices, directed=False):
        self.num_vertices = num_vertices
        self.directed = directed
        self.matrix = [[0] * num_vertices for _ in range(num_vertices)]
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        """Add edge from u to v"""
        self.matrix[u][v] = weight
        if not self.directed:
            self.matrix[v][u] = weight
    
    def remove_edge(self, u, v):
        """Remove edge from u to v"""
        self.matrix[u][v] = 0
        if not self.directed:
            self.matrix[v][u] = 0
    
    def has_edge(self, u, v):
        """Check if edge exists from u to v"""
        return self.matrix[u][v] != 0
    
    def get_neighbors(self, u):
        """Get all neighbors of vertex u"""
        neighbors = []
        for v in range(self.num_vertices):
            if self.matrix[u][v] != 0:
                neighbors.append((v, self.matrix[u][v]))
        return neighbors
    
    def display(self):
        """Display the adjacency matrix"""
        for row in self.matrix:
            print(' '.join(map(str, row)))

# Example usage
graph = AdjacencyMatrix(5)  # 5 vertices
graph.add_edge(0, 1, 2)
graph.add_edge(0, 2, 3)
graph.add_edge(1, 3, 1)
graph.add_edge(2, 4, 4)
graph.add_edge(3, 4, 5)

print("Adjacency Matrix:")
graph.display()

print("\nNeighbors of vertex 0:")
print(graph.get_neighbors(0))
```

#### Analysis
- **Space Complexity**: O(V²) where V is number of vertices
- **Edge Operations**: O(1) time complexity
- **Neighbor Query**: O(V) time complexity
- **Best For**: Dense graphs (many edges)

### Adjacency List

#### Concept
Array of lists where each index contains list of connected vertices.

#### Implementation
```python
class AdjacencyList:
    """Adjacency list representation"""
    
    def __init__(self, num_vertices, directed=False):
        self.num_vertices = num_vertices
        self.directed = directed
        self.list = [[] for _ in range(num_vertices)]
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        """Add edge from u to v"""
        self.list[u].append((v, weight))
        if not self.directed:
            self.list[v].append((u, weight))
    
    def remove_edge(self, u, v):
        """Remove edge from u to v"""
        self.list[u] = [(x, w) for x, w in self.list[u] if x != v]
        if not self.directed:
            self.list[v] = [(x, w) for x, w in self.list[v] if x != u]
    
    def has_edge(self, u, v):
        """Check if edge exists from u to v"""
        return any(x == v for x, _ in self.list[u])
    
    def get_neighbors(self, u):
        """Get all neighbors of vertex u"""
        return self.list[u]
    
    def display(self):
        """Display the adjacency list"""
        for i, neighbors in enumerate(self.list):
            print(f"{i}: {neighbors}")

# Example usage
graph = AdjacencyList(5)
graph.add_edge(0, 1, 2)
graph.add_edge(0, 2, 3)
graph.add_edge(1, 3, 1)
graph.add_edge(2, 4, 4)
graph.add_edge(3, 4, 5)

print("Adjacency List:")
graph.display()
```

#### Analysis
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) where E is number of edges
- **Edge Operations**: O(1) average, O(degree) worst case
- **Neighbor Query**: O(degree) time complexity
- **Best For**: Sparse graphs (few edges)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

#### Concept

#### Implementation
```python
from collections import deque

class GraphTraversal:
    """Graph traversal algorithms"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def bfs(graph, start, adjacency_list=True):
        """Breadth-First Search traversal"""
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([start])
        traversal_order = []
        
        while queue:
            vertex = queue.popleft()
            
            if vertex not in visited:
                visited.add(vertex)
                traversal_order.append(vertex)
                
                # Get neighbors based on graph representation
                if adjacency_list:
                    neighbors = graph.get_neighbors(vertex)
                    neighbors = [v for v, _ in neighbors]
                else:
                    neighbors = [v for v in range(len(graph.matrix)) 
                               if graph.has_edge(vertex, v)]
                
                for neighbor in neighbors:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return traversal_order, visited
    
    @staticmethod
    def dfs(graph, start, adjacency_list=True):
        """Depth-First Search traversal"""
        visited = set()
        stack = [start]
        traversal_order = []
        
        while stack:
            vertex = stack.pop()
            
            if vertex not in visited:
                visited.add(vertex)
                traversal_order.append(vertex)
                
                # Get neighbors
                if adjacency_list:
                    neighbors = graph.get_neighbors(vertex)
                    neighbors = [v for v, _ in neighbors][::-1]  # Reverse for consistent order
                else:
                    neighbors = [v for v in range(len(graph.matrix)) 
                               if graph.has_edge(vertex, v)][::-1]
                
                for neighbor in neighbors:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        stack.append(neighbor)
        
        return traversal_order, visited

# Example usage
graph = AdjacencyList(6)
edges = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4),
    (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
]

for u, v in edges:
    graph.add_edge(u, v)

print("BFS traversal starting from vertex 0:")
bfs_order, bfs_visited = GraphTraversal.bfs(graph, 0)
print(f"Order: {bfs_order}")
print(f"Visited: {bfs_visited}")

print("\nDFS traversal starting from vertex 0:")
dfs_order, dfs_visited = GraphTraversal.dfs(graph, 0)
print(f"Order: {dfs_order}")
print(f"Visited: {dfs_visited}")
```

#### Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for visited set and queue/stack
- **BFS Properties**: Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs
- **DFS Properties**: Good for exploring all paths, memory efficient

                        # Add neighbors
                        if adjacency_list:
                            neighbors = graph.get_neighbors(current)
                            neighbors = [v for v, _ in neighbors]
                        else:
                            neighbors = [v for v in range(graph.num_vertices) 
                                       if graph.has_edge(current, v)]
                        
                        for neighbor in neighbors:

                components.append(component)
        
        return components

# Example usage
graph = AdjacencyList(8)

    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0),  # Component 1
    (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3),  # Component 2
    (6, 7)  # Component 3

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Best Use Case |
|------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| BFS | O(V + E) | O(V) | Shortest path, unweighted |
| DFS | O(V + E) | O(V) | Connectivity, path existence |
| Dijkstra | O((V + E) log V) | O(V) | Shortest path, non-negative weights |
| Bellman-Ford | O(V × E) | O(V) | Negative weights, cycle detection |
| Floyd-Warshall | O(V³) | O(V²) | All-pairs shortest paths |
| Prim's MST | O(E log V) | O(V) | Minimum spanning tree |
| Kruskal's MST | O(E log E) | O(V) | Minimum spanning tree |
| Topological Sort | O(V + E) | O(V) | DAG ordering |
| Kosaraju's SCC | O(V + E) | O(V) | Strongly connected components |

### Memory Usage Patterns

#### Graph Size Impact
- **Sparse Graphs**: E ≈ V, adjacency lists preferred
- **Dense Graphs**: E ≈ V², adjacency matrices preferred
- **Memory Trade-offs**: Time vs space complexity

#### Algorithm-Specific Memory
- **BFS**: O(V) for queue + visited set
- **DFS**: O(V) for stack + visited set
- **Dijkstra**: O(V) for priority queue + distances
- **Floyd-Warshall**: O(V²) for distance matrix

## Optimization Techniques

### Algorithm Selection Guide
```python
def choose_shortest_path_algorithm(graph, has_negative_weights, all_pairs=False):
    """Choose appropriate shortest path algorithm"""
    if all_pairs:
        if graph.num_vertices <= 100:  # Small graphs
            return "Floyd-Warshall"
        else:
            return "Run Dijkstra from each vertex"
    else:
        if has_negative_weights:
            return "Bellman-Ford"
        else:
            return "Dijkstra"

def choose_graph_representation(num_vertices, num_edges, dense_threshold=0.1):
    """Choose appropriate graph representation"""
    density = num_edges / (num_vertices * (num_vertices - 1))
    
    if density > dense_threshold:
        return "Adjacency Matrix"
    else:
        return "Adjacency List"

# Example usage
print("Algorithm selection recommendations:")
print(f"  For 50 vertices, 100 edges: {choose_graph_representation(50, 100)}")
print(f"  For 50 vertices, 1000 edges: {choose_graph_representation(50, 1000)}")
print(f"  Shortest path (no negative): {choose_shortest_path_algorithm(None, False)}")
print(f"  Shortest path (with negative): {choose_shortest_path_algorithm(None, True)}")
```
